My name is Allen Djal and I'm a design, branding, and marketing creator & leader currently helping to jumpstart [VAST Data](https://www.vastdata.com/). I've been fortunate to work with great enterprise teams such as [Dell Technologies](https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/index.htm), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/), [DDN Storage](https://www.ddn.com/), [Quantum](https://www.quantum.com/) and more.

For 10+ years Iâ€™ve worked with/lead teams that have built, launched and managed over 30 brands from humble startup to powerful enterprise. As a result, I've helped hundreds of forward-thinking companies create better customer experiences for millions of users.

With internal team and external agency experience, my deep understanding of how to accomplish the business needs of both **creative and marketing departments** has enabled me to pioneer a one-of-a-kind body of work.

Away from work, I'm an electronic music enthusiast, basketball fan, and big time foodie. Reach out if you want to work together, share ideas or just talk shop.
